# Murder Mystery Game Pseudocode
# Read the notes below and create pseudocode or an outline for your text-based adventure game as comments in a Python file. Create a repository on GitHub and post the link to your repository here (make sure it's public). Only feedback will be given for this task. Not for marks.

# Initialize game variables
1. Define player attributes (name, inventory, clues, suspects)
2. Define game world (locations, items, suspects, and the murder scene)
3. Define the murder mystery details (victim, murder weapon, motive)

# Function to start the game
def start_game():
    # Display welcome message
    # Get player name
    # Initialize player attributes and inventory
    # Set starting location (e.g., the murder scene)

# Function to display the current location
def display_location():
    # Show current location description
    # List available actions (e.g., investigate, move, talk to suspects)

# Function to move between locations
def move(direction):
    # Check if the direction is valid
    # Update player's current location
    # Call display_location()

# Function to investigate the current location
def investigate():
    # Check for clues or items in the current location
    # If clues are found, add to inventory
    # Display found clues or items

# Function to talk to suspects
def talk_to_suspect(suspect_name):
    # Check if the suspect is present in the current location
    # Display suspect's dialogue and possible motives
    # Add any new clues or information to inventory

# Function to check inventory
def check_inventory():
    # Display items and clues collected by the player

# Function to check player's progress
def check_progress():
    # Evaluate the collected clues and suspects
    # Provide hints or feedback on what to do next

# Function to make an accusation
def make_accusation(suspect_name):
    # Verify if the accusation is valid based on collected clues
    # If valid, display outcome (correct or incorrect)
    # Call game_over() if the accusation is correct or if the player wants to quit

# Function for game over scenario
def game_over(outcome):
    # Display game over message (success or failure)
    # Offer option to restart or exit

# Main game loop
def main():
    # Call start_game()
    # While the game is ongoing:
        # Call display_location()
        # Get user input for action (investigate, move, talk, check inventory, accuse)
        # Process action using corresponding function
        # Call check_progress()

# Start the game
main()
